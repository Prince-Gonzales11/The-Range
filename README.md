# The Range — 3D Aim Training & Virtual Learning Experience

## Project Story & Concept
The Range is an immersive 3D aim‑training experience built for the browser. You enter a virtual firing range as a trainee and progress through Beginner, Intermediate, and Professional scenarios. Each session blends reflex training, spatial awareness, and decision‑making under time pressure. It provides instant feedback through accuracy, score, and achievements, turning deliberate practice into an engaging learning loop.

Educational goals:
- Build hand–eye coordination and reaction time
- Improve spatial reasoning and target prioritization
- Encourage data‑driven self‑assessment with high‑scores and post‑game analytics

## Relevance to XR/Game/3D Learning
- Uses real‑time 3D rendering to simulate a training range with dynamic targets
- Pointer‑lock controls, physics‑like motion, collision checks, spatial audio
- Structured difficulty tiers that scaffold learning from fundamentals to mastery

## Features
- Three difficulty modes with tuned target count, speed, and timing
- Realistic GLTF weapon, background textures, and multi‑instance audio
- Authenticated sessions with JWT cookies and personal high‑scores
- Live HUD: score, timer, accuracy; post‑game achievements and summary
- Resilient asset loading with progress UI and graceful fallbacks

## Architecture
Full‑stack, modular design with clear separation of concerns:
- Frontend (Vite + Three.js)
  - `src/main.js`: game loop, input, shooting, collisions, scoring
  - `src/manager.js`: UIManager for HUD, loading screen, toasts, post‑game overlay
  - `src/components/Target.js`: target lifecycle, movement, collision
  - `src/levels/*.js`: difficulty configs (Beginner/Intermediate/Professional)
  - `index.html` + `public/*`: static assets (textures, model, audio, CSS)
- Backend (Express)
   Folder renamed from server → api
  - `api/index.js`: auth, score APIs, cookie/JWT handling, CORS
  - `api/db.js`: Neon PostgreSQL pool, schema init, queries, upsert best scores
- Database (Neon PostgreSQL)
  - `users`: identity and password hash
  - `user_scores`: best score per difficulty with constraints and indices

Runtime topology:
```

Browser (Vite 5173) ── proxy /api ──► Express API (3001) ──► Neon PostgreSQL
         Three.js game                      Auth & Scores      users, user_scores
```


## Schemas
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.users (

id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);


CREATE TABLE public.user_scores (
    username TEXT,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    mode TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (mode IN ('Beginner','Intermediate','Professional')),
    best_score INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, mode)
);

UTILITY QUERIES:

SELECT * FROM public.users;

SELECT * FROM public.user_scores;

TRUNCATE TABLE public.user_scores; 
TRUNCATE TABLE public.users RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;


## Development Stack
- Frontend: Vite, Three.js, PointerLockControls, GLTFLoader
- Backend: Express, CORS, cookie‑parser, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
- Database:Neon PostgreSQL (via pg node client)
- Configuration: `.env` via `dotenv`
- Testing: Vitest (unit), Supertest (API)

## Setup & Installation
Prerequisites:
- `Node.js` 18+
- Neon PostgreSQL database (cloud or local compatible)

Steps:
1. Create database: `The-Range-DB`
2. Copy or edit `.env`:
   - `PGHOST=ep-divine-hill-a1ym9h6z-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech`
   - `PGPORT=5432`
   - `PGDATABASE=neondb`
   - `PGUSER=neon-username`
   - `PGPASSWORD=your-neon-password`
   - `JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-prod`
3. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
4. Start backend:
   - `npm run server` (starts `http://localhost:3001`)
5. Start frontend:
   - `npm run dev` (opens `http://localhost:5173` with `/api` proxied)
6. Sign up, log in, pick a level, and play.


## API Overview
- `POST /api/auth/signup` → create account (server‑side validation)
- `POST /api/auth/login` → set `auth_token` http‑only cookie
- `POST /api/auth/logout` → clears cookie
- `GET /api/auth/me` → current user from JWT
- `GET /api/scores/me` → best scores for authenticated user
- `POST /api/scores/update` → upsert best score per difficulty

## Team Roles
- Prince Johnard Gonzales (Backend & Database)

- Database: Organizes and stores all player data, scores, and account information.

- Security: Handles user logins and passwords.

Ryan Ranada (Frontend & 3D)

- 3D Visuals: Builds the 3D shooting range environment and visual assets.

- Gameplay: Programs how the game plays (aiming, shooting, and moving).

- Interface: Creates the menus, scoreboards, and on-screen displays (HUD) the player sees.

## Security & Best Practices
- Strong password policy and server‑side validation
- JWT in secure, http‑only cookie with limited lifetime
- Parameterized queries and transaction use for schema init
- CORS and proxy separation between client and server
